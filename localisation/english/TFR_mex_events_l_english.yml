 mexico.100.t:0 "Mexico's Fourth Transformation"
 mexico.100.d:0 "A new year begins in AMLOs administration of Mexico. Since his landslide victory in 2018 he has pursued what he has called the Fourth Transformation a complete break from the old political order. He continues to speak about expanding social programs and fighting what he calls the mafia of power. \n\nEvery morning he addresses the media in his daily conferences 'Las Mañaneras'. Many praise him for his incredible work in the country while others continue to question the rising number of murders and disappearances as well as economic stagnation. He often dismisses these criticisms claiming that he has other data or blaming the neoliberal past.\n\nThe recent Culiacanazo in which the Sinaloa Cartel was able to lay siege to an entire city and force the authorities to release Ovidio Guzman Lopez along with the growing tension surrounding a possible COVID pandemic and many other events has raised serious doubts about the administration. Even so the popular support for President AMLO remains undeniable."

 mexico.101.d:0 "Today, the global pandemic has officially reached Mexican soil. Health authorities confirmed the country's first case of COVID-19: a 35-year-old man in Mexico City who had recently returned from Italy. After presenting symptoms and undergoing laboratory tests, the Ministry of Health announced the positive results, so suddenly the pandemic became a matter of National concern \nAlmost immediately, attention turned to a second suspected case in the state of Sinaloa, where another traveler was placed under observation."

 mexico.102.t:0 "Ingrid Escamilla's Case"
 mexico.102.d:0 "Some days ago, the murder of Ingrid Escamilla in Mexico City shocked the nation. Details of the crime, and the subsequent leak of graphic images to the press, ignited a wave of anger that spread far beyond the capital. Within days, protests emerged across the country, denouncing not only the brutality of the act but the broader crisis of gender violence that has plagued Mexico for years.\nFor the government, the case immediately became a test of both credibility and capacity. Public institutions faced criticism for their handling of evidence, their treatment of victims, and their inability to stem the rising tide of femicides. Demonstrators painted slogans on government buildings, filled public squares, and demanded urgent reforms. Calls grew louder for accountability and protection, particularly for women who felt abandoned by the justice system"

 mexico.103.t:0 "Oil Crisis"
 mexico.103.d:0 "The outbreak of the Prince Rebellion in Saudi Arabia has torn through the global petroleum market with unprecedented force. The sudden collapse of stability in the world's largest oil exporter has sent prices into violent swings, paralyzing supply chains and destabilizing economies on every continent. Mexico, already weakened by the dual shock of COVID-19 and domestic uncertainty, now faces an external crisis it cannot shield itself from.\n\nFor decades, oil has been both a pillar of the national economy and a volatile burden. The turbulence from Riyadh has only deepened this contradiction. The peso has faltered under renewed pressure, Pemex's already fragile finances are under strain, and revenues the government counted on for social programs and infrastructure are evaporating. Energy reform, once a contentious domestic issue, is now overshadowed by forces beyond Mexico's control.\n\nIn cabinet meetings, the dilemma is plain: how to preserve stability at home when international markets are in free fall. Officials speak of waiting for the oil market to stabilize, but behind closed doors the reality is acknowledged - this is not a passing disruption. It is a global crisis with no clear resolution, and Mexico's room to maneuver is narrowing by the day."

 mexico.120.t:0 "A DAWN OF A CENTURY"
 mexico.120.d:0 "The unthinkable has come to pass. The United States, long regarded as the guarantor of global order, has fractured into civil war. The disputed 2020 presidential election, pitting Joseph Biden against Donald Trump, escalated beyond the limits of democratic resolution. Political polarization, mistrust of institutions, and armed mobilization among the population have now torn the nation apart.\n\nFor over a century, the United States stood as the preeminent power of the world. It endured economic crises, foreign wars, and the turbulence of the 20th century without losing its primacy. Challenges were many, but Washington remained a constant presence - a neighbor whose weight shaped every decision in our hemisphere.\n\nThat era has ended. What began as political unrest has transformed into an armed struggle, dividing states, communities, and even families. Federal authority has collapsed in large parts of the country, and rival factions now claim legitimacy. The implications for Mexico are profound. Our largest trading partner and our most powerful neighbor is no longer a single actor, but a battlefield. Borders, commerce, migration, and security are all subject to forces we cannot control.\n\nFrom the perspective of this government, the situation requires immediate vigilance. We face the dual task of protecting our sovereignty and preparing for the unpredictable consequences of a conflict on our northern frontier. The world has entered a new century, and it begins with the fall of the United States."

 mexico.121.t:0 "The Refugee Crisis"
 mexico.121.d:0 "The eruption of hostilities across the northern border has unleashed a wave of human displacement without precedent in modern history. As the United States descends into civil war, thousands - and soon, potentially millions - of its citizens are seeking refuge in our territory. Entire families arrive at crossings along the northern frontier, fleeing not only the violence of armed militias but the collapse of civil order in their communities.\n\nThe situation is most acute in the southern regions of the United States, where federal forces, constitutionalist factions, and extremist militias are locked in brutal conflict. With cities under siege and infrastructure collapsing, civilians have little choice but to move southward in search of safety and stability. Mexico, once accustomed to being a country of out-migration, now faces the unprecedented challenge of becoming a country of refuge.\n\nBorder authorities are overwhelmed, local governments struggle to provide shelter, and the social fabric in frontier states is under strain. The humanitarian imperative is clear, yet the resources are limited. Cabinet discussions now revolve around balancing national security with the need to uphold Mexico's international commitments. The refugee crisis is no longer a distant scenario - it is our new reality."
 mexico.121.a:0 "An Ironic Situation"

 mexico.122.t:0 "Hell over the Earth"
 mexico.122.d:0 "The latest reports from the northern frontier leave no room for doubt. The refugee crisis has turned into a disaster for those fleeing the civil war in the United States. The number of people crossing the border has overwhelmed every available institution. For every refugee who reaches safety in our cities, nearly as many vanish into the control of cartels and criminal groups. Journalists and aid workers have documented stories of forced recruitment, human trafficking, sexual violence, and clandestine camps where migrants are exploited as slave labor.\nThe police and the National Guard lack the capacity to respond to the scale of events unfolding across the country. Communities that once acted with solidarity now express fear and anger, worried that cartel expansion under the cover of this crisis will further erode the security and stability of Mexico.\n\nIn response, the government has begun planning a new phase of action. Military deployments are under consideration, not only to protect refugees but to confront the criminal organizations that are profiting from their suffering. What began as a humanitarian challenge is rapidly escalating into a national security threat, one that may define the coming years."

 mexico.123.t:0 "The Missing Crisis"
 mexico.123.d:0 "Since our previous Cartel War over the beginning of this century Mexico has suffered the 'Missing Crisis', before 2021 over 100,000 people has been declared missing without ever founding them, or at least their bodies. \nWith the increasing number of refugees entering into our country this number has skyrocketed into historic numbers. Within the last weeks since the beginning of the American Civil War at least 50,000 new reports were done to the government as refugees and citizens are forced to desappear by criminal groups."
