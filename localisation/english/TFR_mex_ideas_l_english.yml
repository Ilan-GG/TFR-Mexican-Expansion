 MEX_obrador_transformation_dynamic: "La §s4T§! (The Fourth Transformation)"
 MEX_obrador_transformation_dynamic_desc: "The Fourth Transformation is the grand, almost spiritual, name bestowed by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador upon his entire political project. He frames it not merely as a policy platform, but as the fourth great upheaval in Mexican history, placing it in the same historic pantheon as Independence, the Reform Laws, and the Revolution. This ambitious comparison is a classic AMLO maneuver: it immediately elevates his agenda above the petty squabbles of everyday politics and frames opposition not as disagreement, but as a betrayal of the nation's destiny.\nThe stated mission of the 4T, as it's known, is to purge Mexico of the corruption and 'neoliberal' rot that AMLO argues has plagued it for decades. The strategy is a direct reflection of his long-held beliefs: massive social programs like youth scholarships and pensions for the elderly are delivered directly to the people, bypassing what he sees as untrustworthy intermediaries. Grandiose infrastructure projects, from oil refineries to a tourist railway in the south, are pitched not just as economic engines but as symbols of national sovereignty reclaimed."

 MEX_hugs_not_bullets_1: "Hugs, not Bullets"
 MEX_hugs_not_bullets_1_desc: "'Abrazos, no Balazos' (Hugs, Not Bullets) is the deceptively simple name for President López Obrador's radical approach to Mexico's security crisis. Rejecting the militarized 'war on drugs' of his predecessors, the philosophy argues that you cannot shoot your way out of a social problem. Instead, the strategy focuses on what AMLO sees as the root causes of violence: poverty and a lack of opportunity. The plan invests in youth programs and economic development, betting that a hopeful populace is less likely to be lured by cartels.\nTo his supporters, this is a visionary and humane shift, finally treating crime as a societal illness rather than just a military threat. To his many critics, however, the policy is dangerously naïve, an invitation for criminal groups to expand their power with impunity. They point to persistent violence as proof that 'hugs' are no match for bullets. Yet, whether seen as wisdom or weakness, the phrase perfectly encapsulates AMLO's core belief: that true security comes from healing a broken society, not just from confronting its symptoms with force."

 MEX_war_against_cartels_1: "Shoot, then Ask"
 MEX_war_against_cartels_1_desc: "The philosophy of 'Abrazos, no Balazos' has been declared a noble but fatal failure. In this grim new assessment, the cartels are not merely criminals to be dissuaded, but a parasitic organism that has burrowed deep into the flesh of the Mexican state. Past administrations are condemned for trying to lop off a limb here or there, only for the parasite to grow back stronger. Now, the argument goes, it is too late for the patient, empathetic approach AMLO once championed for what he now calls a 'rotting' system.\nThis hardened stance discards social programs as a primary security tool in favor of a relentless, militarized campaign. The new guiding principle is not rehabilitation, but eradication. Supporters of this shift hail it as a necessary, if brutal, awakening—a final war for the nation's very soul, unencumbered by the perceived naivete of the past. Critics, however, see it as a tragic admission of defeat and a descent into the very cycle of violence the president once denounced, warning that flooding the streets with soldiers may wound the parasite, but risk killing the host in the process."
