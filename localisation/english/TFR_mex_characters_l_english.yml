 MEX_andres_manuel_lopez_obrador_char_desc: "Andrés Manuel López Obrador is the most transformative Mexican politician in modern history. A native of the small rural town of Tepetitán, in the state of Tabasco, AMLO transformed his beginnings in local politics into a national movement devoted to his vision of moral renewal more than anything else. He first made a name for himself as a persistent critic of the ruling party's establishment running as presidential candidate of 2006 and 2012 with PRD, but finally broke through during the 2018 Presidential elections. In a landslide victory, he and his young party, MORENA, swept aside the traditional political giants that had governed Mexico for nearly a century. The man the political elite had dismissed as a perennial leftist protest candidate was now President of the United Mexican States.\n\nNearly everything about López Obrador, from his policies to his personality, defies the conventional wisdom in Mexico City. He's carried over several of his trademark philosophies from his days as an activist: the political adversary is not just wrong, but part of a corrupt mafia of power; public works are a moral imperative for the poor, regardless of the cost; and when criticized, never, EVER concede the high ground, but instead attack the critics as privileged enemies of the people. His supporters praise him as authentically humble, giving power back to the forgotten masses, and courageously dismantling a neoliberal system that served only the rich. His many critics, meanwhile, condemn him as an authoritarian populist who panders to the poor with handouts, willfully undermines independent institutions, and sees any opposition as a personal betrayal. But few on either side of the political divide deny his profound connection with the base of Mexican society, and his skill at shaping the national conversation, whether for or against him."
